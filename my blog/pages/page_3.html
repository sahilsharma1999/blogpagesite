       <h1>Tips to Get Lean Fast: How to Get Lean and Toned<br></h1>
       <q>Want to get lean fast? The key to the look you want is to know how to get lean fast. Follow these tips to get in great shape.</q>
       <h2>Ditch the bodybuilding advice<br></h2>
       <p>Most of the fitness information you come across is from the gospel of the big and bulky. The six meal a day plans, the endless protein and marathon gym sessions are all designed to get you bigger, not necessarily better. But who in their right mind wants to just be bigger?</p>
       <p>There is a certain amount of mass your bone structure looks good carrying. Going over it is going overboard, and it's not a good look. People would much prefer the look of a catalogue or underwear model to the pumped up bodybuilder look. So if you don't want to get what they have got, you probably don't want to do what they do.<br></p>
       <h2>Use your nutrition plan to drop fat</h2>
       <p><br>Knowing how to eat right is key to the lean look. Some say 90% of the way you look in fact, so getting this right is fundamental to being able to get in shape fast</p>
       <p><br>Of course eating "right" in this instance means in a way that will get you lean, and keep you there. Sustainability is huge, since 95% of people who lose weight gain it back. Lean and toned should be for life. To do this you need to find and use a way of eating that works for you.</p>    
        <h2><br>Use intermittent fasting and fasted workouts</h2>
        <p><br>One of the most powerful and popular ways is to use Intermittent Fasting. This is simply taking a break from eating for a short period of time, and it's a favourite of celebrities and fitness models everywhere. There are various benefits such as detoxification, and increased growth hormone output for increased fat burning, but the most obvious, and powerful, is that it helps you to create the energy deficit required for losing body fat.</p>
        <h2>Eat less without losing your mind</h2>
        <p><br>Most diets make you feel deprived, and it's not fun. Of course the key to being able to get lean fast is to eat less, but you want to do it in a way that doesn't drive you crazy. Use simple tricks so you eat less, but feel satisfied.</p>
        <h2>Load up on veggies and salads</h2>
        <p><br> These foods are not only virtually calorie free, meaning you can eat them with immunity, but they are dense with nutrients. this means they are more satisfying and stop you feeling hungry. Eat as much as you like, then have some more!</p>
        <h2>Eat at the table</h2>
        <p><br>We are so used to eating on the go, and not paying attention to what goes in our mouths that we don't really know whether we are satisfied or not. When you literally make a meal of eating you will pay attention and this will help you get lean.</p>
         <p><br>The trick is to get lean without giving up your life. As the saying goes "sexy doesn't try too hard."</p>
